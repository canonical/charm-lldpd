"description": |
  LLDP is an industry standard protocol designed to supplant proprietary
  Link-Layer protocols such as Extreme's EDP (Extreme Discovery
  Protocol) and CDP (Cisco Discovery Protocol). The goal of LLDP is to
  provide an inter-vendor compatible mechanism to deliver Link-Layer
  notifications to adjacent network devices.  This implementation
  provides LLDP sending and reception, supports VLAN and includes an
  SNMP subagent that can interface to an SNMP agent through AgentX
  protocol.  This daemon is also able to deal with CDP, SONMP, FDP and
  EDP protocol. It also handles LLDP-MED extension.
