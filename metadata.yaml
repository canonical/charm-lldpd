title: LLDPd Operator
summary: An operator that provides lldpd.
description: |
  An operator charm that provides the link-layer discovery protocol (LLDP) services.
  This operator installs and manages the lldpd package and services.

  LLDP is a layer 2 neighbor discovery protocol that allows devices to advertise their
  device information to their neighbors.

  LLDP is generally disabled by default on Linux bridges which block the transmission
  of LLDP packets by default. As such, the use of this LLDP in an environment configured
  with Linux bridging may need additional tweaks at the host level.
